### Dynamic Web Applications Project: Chart the Stock Market

My [stock-watching](https://stock-watching.herokuapp.com/ "stock-watching").

#### Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: http://watchstocks.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

##### Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new - Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects.

##### Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
- User Story: I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
- User Story: I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
- User Story: I can remove stocks.
- User Story: I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.
